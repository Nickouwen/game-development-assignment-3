 Studio Assignment 3 for COSC 416 Game Development, Nicolaas Kouwenhoven 60504180

## Functionality
 
 1. Can look around using third person camera; I did not use cinemachine as the rotation was frustrating to figure out, and I just implemented similar to in-class demo

 2. Can move around using WASD keys; Movement will follow camera's rotation

 3. Can jump onto elevated platforms as shown in video

 4. Movement was tuned utilizing the linearvelocity attribute of the rigidBody, creating a sort of 'air brake' effect, while that effect also helps the player stop on the ground

 5. Boxes and invisible walls are implemented; Invisible walls not shown in video, but they are there.

 6. Rotating collectible coins are there, and handle collisions to add score and remove themselves

 7. Git history is decent. I did a bit of work before my first commit but was better about it after that point.

 8. This is the README
